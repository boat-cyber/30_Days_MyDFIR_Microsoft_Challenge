Day 2 (Provisioning and securing a Windows Server VM)
•	Created an Azure Windows Server VM.
•	Implemented network-level controls using an Azure Network Security Group (NSG) to restrict RDP to my management IP.
•	Hardened the VM’s Windows Firewall and RDP settings.
•	Successfully connected via RDP (using restricted NSG rule).

Day 3 (Create Log Analytics Workspace and Deploy Microsoft Sentinel)
Created a Log Analytics Workspace in Azure to collect and analyze security event data.
Deployed Microsoft Sentinel and connected it to the workspace for centralized security monitoring and investigation.

Day 4 (Export Activity Logs and Explore KQL)
•	Exported Azure Subscription Activity Logs to monitor administrative and resource-level actions within the environment.
•	Loaded training data from the Microsoft Sentinel Training Lab solution to simulate security events.
•	Began exploring KQL (Kusto Query Language) for querying logs, focusing on detecting failed logins and authentication activity

Day 5 (Create Microsoft Sentinel Dashboard)
•	Created a custom Microsoft Sentinel dashboard to visualize key security metrics and insights from ingested data.
•	Added widgets for failed logons, authentication trends, and alert summaries to enhance real-time visibility into security events.
•	Customized layout and filters to support faster incident triage and analysis.

Day 6 (Connect Microsoft Defender XDR and Create Analytic Rule)
•	Connected Microsoft Defender XDR to Microsoft Sentinel to unify threat data and enhance detection capabilities across endpoints and cloud workloads.
•	Created a custom analytic rule in Sentinel using sample log data to simulate and detect brute-force attack patterns.
•	Tested the rule’s trigger logic and verified alert generation in the Sentinel incident’s view.

Day 7 (KQL Analysis of Failed and Successful Logons)
•	Used Kusto Query Language (KQL) to identify accounts experiencing the highest number of failed logons, indicating possible brute-force attempts. 
•	Extended the investigation by querying for successful logins from the same accounts to determine potential compromise points and login sources. 
•	Analyzed patterns and correlations between failed and successful authentication events to strengthen incident detection logic.

Day 8 (Bookmark Notable KQL Results and Create an Incident)
•	Ran a KQL query in Microsoft Sentinel to identify notable security events within the ingested log data.
•	Bookmarked a significant result for deeper investigation and evidence tracking.
•	Created an incident directly from the bookmarked event to simulate real-world SOC response workflows, linking analytical findings to actionable security cases.
